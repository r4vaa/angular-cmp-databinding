View encapsulation
there are three types of encapsulation that are:
1) Emulated:- this encapsulation propogates from the main html to the component where it is defined.
2) Native:- this encapsulation does propogates fromt the main html so, it only exsist in that component.
3) None:- styles is encapsulated from main component to all the component and visilbe to all component.

this note was given just to test what i knw and ill continue to write everything from now onwards.
View encapsulation
there are three types of encapsulation that are:
1) Emulated:- this encapsulation propogates from the main html to the component where it is defined.
2) Native:- this encapsulation does propogates fromt the main html so, it only exsist in that component.
3) None:- styles is encapsulated from main component to all the component and visilbe to all component.

local reference
instead of using data binding we can use local reference we can easily fetch data from local template component to local typescript component for using local reference
firt create a local reference uisng #name_of_local_reference after adding this then add it to the method that we are using
then add it to the type script
method(name_of_local_reference: HTMLInputElement)
this.name_of_local_reference.value
this is how we can use local reference
